                    Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Hannah. I am life giver to one beautiful daughter whom I am thankfully able to raise currently as a stay-at-home parent. I am in school full time pursuing my AAS in Computer Science from Renton Technical College with plans to go for my BAS soon after. My love for technology started early. Some of my best memories include sitting on my fathers lap watching him type away on a big bulky keyboard navigating DOS. Being born in 1994 meant that I missed the beginning of the computer age but the early 2000's were still a time of wonderment in technology with everything constantly evolving and transforming.

                    <p> My first games were things like 'The Oregon Trail' on that beloved floppy disk. I spent many late nights and early mornings playing Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis with some kids in town. 'Zombies Ate My Neighbors' will always have a special place in my heart. For my twelfth birthday I was given a PlayStation2 and it was on from there, some of my all time favorites being the 'Jak & Daxter' series and of course 'Ratchet & Clank' as well. I devoted a good portion of seven years of my life to the great World Of Warcraft. My love of gaming has brought me many years of joy, laughter, friendship and even learning. My biggest dream in life is to be able to use my skills as a programmer to create games that my daughter can enjoy, play with and learn from.
