            Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Hannah Angel. I am a
            student of computer science, currently pursuing my Bachelors in
            Mobile Application Development and I am hoping to graduate in 2025.
            Currently I hold an Associates in Computer Science from Renton
            Technical College. I have a strong passion for creating beautful
            things whether that be mobile app or a website. I am a big fan of
            color as you can see and love to bring a little color and light
            wherever I go! I enjoy solving problems, teaching others when I can
            and always learning things! Some of my best memories include sitting
            on my fathers lap watching him type away navigating DOS. Being born
            in 1994 meant that I missed the beginning of the computer age but
            the early 2000's were still a time of wonderment in technology with
            everything constantly evolving and transforming.

          <p>Some of my interests include...</p>
          <dt>Video Games</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              My first games were things like 'The Oregon Trail' on that beloved
              floppy disk. I spent many late nights and early mornings playing
              Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis with some kids in town. 'Zombies Ate
              My Neighbors' will always have a special place in my heart. For my
              twelfth birthday I was given a PlayStation2 and it was on from
              there, some of my all time favorites being the 'Jak & Daxter'
              series and of course 'Ratchet & Clank' as well. I devoted a good
              portion of seven years of my life to the great World Of Warcraft.
              My love of gaming has brought me many years of joy, laughter,
              friendship and even learning. My biggest dream in life is to be
              able to use my skills as a programmer to create games that my
              daughter can enjoy, play with and learn from. My goals are many
              and wide and varied but the biggest ones now are completing my
              degree and possibly going on to pursue my Bachelors degree in
              Applied Sciences with a specialty in application development. RTC
              has been a wonderful school to me so far and I am excited to see
              what the future holds both for the school, myself and my family.

          <dt>Learning New Things</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              I have always loved to learn whether it was from a teacher I
              liked, books that I've read or just collecting random bits of
              knowledge throughout my life. I actually struggled quite a bit
              when I was in grade school, I had a hard time following along and
              being interested in what we were learning. I've always preferred
              to learn in my own style and on my own time line. I used to spend
              hours in my room reading college level books that my father would
              bring home for me. Everything from sciences of all kinds to
              attempting Calculus practice questions found in the books.
              Throughout my life if I come across something I have never heard
              of I always make a point to do a little research and learn about
              it. I may never need to use that knowledge but I enjoy the process
              of learning and researching things.

              I have always loved the outdoors, from walking trails in the
              forest to camping out at the ocean. I love exploring whether it is
              by myself for a little personal time or with my husband and
              daughter. We love to take her out to explore the outside
