                Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Hannah Angel. I am a
                student of computer science, currently pursuing my Bachelors in
                Mobile Application Development and I am hoping to graduate in
                2025. Currently I hold an Associates in Computer Science from
                Renton Technical College. I have a strong passion for creating
                beautful things whether that be mobile applications, small games
                or websites. I am a big fan of color as you can see and strive
                to bring a little light wherever I go! I enjoy solving problems,
                helping others, teaching others what I have learned and I always
                strive to learn deeply!
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of my best memories include sitting on my fathers lap
                watching him type away navigating DOS. Being born in 1994 meant
                that I missed the beginning of the computer age but the early
                2000's were still a time of wonderment in technology with
                everything constantly evolving and transforming.
              </p>
              <p>
                My biggest dream in life is to be able to use my skills as a
                programmer to create games that my daughter can enjoy, play with
                and learn from. I have many goals and keep my horizons wide but as of now I am focused on completing. Bachelors degree in Applied Sciences with a specialty in application development. RTC has been a wonderful school to me so far and I am excited to see what the future
                holds both for the school, myself and my family.

                  page.

                  uses CSS and HTML and the goal of this webpage is to not only
                  be my portfolio but also to practice responsive web design and

              My first games were things like 'The Oregon Trail' on that beloved
              floppy disk. I spent many late nights and early mornings playing
              Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis with some kids in town. 'Zombies Ate
              My Neighbors' will always have a special place in my heart. For my
              twelfth birthday I was given a PlayStation2 and it was on from
              there, some of my all time favorites being the 'Jak & Daxter'
              series and of course 'Ratchet & Clank' as well. I devoted a good
              portion of seven years of my life to the great World Of Warcraft.
              My love of gaming has brought me many years of joy, laughter,
              friendship and even learning.

              I have always loved to learn whether it was from a teacher I
              liked, books that I've read or just collecting random bits of
              knowledge throughout my life. I actually struggled quite a bit
              when I was in grade school, I had a hard time following along and
              being interested in what we were learning. I've always preferred
              to learn in my own style and on my own time line. I used to spend
              hours in my room reading college level books that my father would
              bring home for me. Everything from sciences of all kinds to
              attempting Calculus practice questions found in the books.
              Throughout my life if I come across something I have never heard
              of I always make a point to do a little research and learn about
              it. I may never need to use that knowledge but I enjoy the process
              of learning and researching things.

              I have always loved the outdoors, from walking trails in the
              forest to camping out at the ocean. I love exploring whether it is
              by myself for a little personal time or with my husband and
              daughter. We love to take her out to explore the outside
