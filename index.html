                    Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Hannah. I am life giver to one beautiful daughter whom I am thankfully able to raise currently as a stay-at-home parent. I am in school full time pursuing my AAS in Computer Science from Renton Technical College with plans to go for my BAS soon after. My love for technology started early. Some of my best memories include sitting on my fathers lap watching him type away on a big bulky keyboard navigating DOS. Being born in 1994 meant that I missed the beginning of the computer age but the early 2000's were still a time of wonderment in technology with everything constantly evolving and transforming.

                    <p>Some of my interests include...</p>
                    <dt>Video Games</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p> My first games were things like 'The Oregon Trail' on that beloved floppy disk. I spent many late nights and early mornings playing Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis with some kids in town. 'Zombies Ate My Neighbors' will always have a special place in my heart. For my twelfth birthday I was given a PlayStation2 and it was on from there, some of my all time favorites being the 'Jak & Daxter' series and of course 'Ratchet & Clank' as well. I devoted a good portion of seven years of my life to the great World Of Warcraft. My love of gaming has brought me many years of joy, laughter, friendship and even learning. My biggest dream in life is to be able to use my skills as a programmer to create games that my daughter can enjoy, play with and learn from. My goals are many and wide and varied but the biggest ones now are completing my degree and possibly going on to pursue my Bachelors degree in Applied Sciences with a specialty in application development. RTC has been a wonderful school to me so far and I am excited to see what the future holds both for the school, myself and my family.

                <dt>Learning New Things</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p> I have always loved to learn whether it was from a teacher I liked, books that I've read or just collecting random bits of knowledge throughout my life. I actually struggled quite a bit when I was in grade school, I had a hard time following along and being interested in what we were learning. I've always preferred to learn in my own style and on my own time line. I used to spend hours in my room reading college level books that my father would bring home for me. Everything from sciences of all kinds to attempting Calculus practice questions found in the books. Throughout my life if I come across something I have never heard of I always make a point to do a little research and learn about it. I may never need to use that knowledge but I enjoy the process of learning and researching things.</p>

                <dt>The Great Outdoors And Adventuring With My Family</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p> I have always loved the outdoors, from walking trails in the forest to camping out at the ocean. I love exploring whether it is by myself for a little personal time or with my husband and daughter. We love to take her out to explore the outside</p>
