                A project I have been thinking about since before starting my schooling is to design an app that allows quick and easy access to information regarding local resources
                such as food pantries, food banks, hot meal locations, mental health services, pop up medical services, etc. The idea is to create an application that allows the host of a
                service (ex. non profit serving hot meals) to list the service they are providing, its location and details which will then be displayed on the application for easy 
                access by anyone with a phone. This idea could also extend to a companion website for those members of the community without regular access to a smart phone.
