            <p class="project-title">Bubble Yeet: An FPS developed using Unity</p>
            <p class="project-blurb-container">I started Bubble Yeet with the intentions of it being added to my portfolio as a playable demo but due to unforeseen circumstances it will be added to the page a little later than I thought. No worries though, set backs aren't as scary as they may seem. Bubble Yeet is developed in Unity using one of Unity's wonderful tutorials. Below is a short list of updates to give you a look into what I have done with the game thus far.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><p>Update #1: Humble Beginnings</p></dt>
                <dd><p>My thought was that I wanted to create a game to shoot bubbles at enemies and yeet them into space, sounds fun doesn't it? I decided that an FPS(first person shooter) would be an ideal candidate for game type. Going with this thought I used unity's very own FPS game tutorial to create it.</p></dd>
                <dt><p>Update #2: Figure Out The Basics</p></dt>
                <dd><p>Unity tutorial games provide you with a solid foundation to start learning development. They provide a prefab world, already implemented main character and several enemies. They then instruct you on how to add a few simple things to the world using their provided assets. The first thing I did was play through the small, simple already built level that included two robot enemies and one boss level enemy character. This allowed me to get an initial feel for the flow of the game and start coming up with ideas of things I would like to implement to make it my own. Right away I noticed the lack of walls on the outter edges of most of the level, this is good if we are going to be yeeting enemies into the nether. That tells me that I probably won't need a lot of extra terrain/environment assets for this little demo game.</p></dd>
                <dt><p>Update #3: Deciding Where To Start</p></dt>
                <dd><p>Sometimes the hardest part of doing a project is actually just planning it out, at least for me. After I spent some time dinking around with the controls, seeing what scripts there are to reuse and generally going over the game I think I'd like to start small. There's a few fruit objects that were provided, I'd like to turn these into health items that heal you when you come into contact with them. My next step would probably be to think about adding in several more enemies in various places around the map. </p></dd>
                <dt><p>Update #4: Troubles As Usual</p></dt>
                <dd><p>Of course I found myself procrastinating but I brought my attention span back in line long enough to know that I wanted to add a few NPC's into the game as well. A big shout out to Humble Bundle for saving small, aspiring, and broke game developers for as long as they've been around. I picked up a killer Polygon bundle featuring 17 different asset packs with some awesome polygon characters and a few environment packs which should be really helpful in the future.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #5: Attention Span Stops Here</p></dt>
                <dd><p>This is about as far as I have made it with this game. I did import one asset pack from the bundle that I acquired, It's a great futuristic space themed pack so it fits nicely with whats already in the game.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #6: Afterthoughts</p></dt>
                <dd><p>The next thing that I would like to try to implement is to turn the bullets into something that knocks enemies around while doing damage. The show will go on, I am hoping to get more added to this game in the next few weeks.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #7: After the afterthoughts</p></dt>
                <dd><p>I ended up diving back into the game a little bit last night. I messed around with adding another character, it didn't quite go the way I had planned. Apparently I need to learn how a pathfinding system works which should be an interesting endeavor.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #8: Pathfinding, finding a path</p></dt>
                <dd><p>After some short research I have come to the conclusion that I have 2 options to look at for pathfinding. Either I will need to find a good one that I can implement myself or I need to create one. From what I can tell it can be a relatively simple task but does involve using algorithms which I am absolutely not familiar with at all. Sounds like it may be a good learning opportunity and I know just the person to ask.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #9: Rambling Thoughts</p></dt>
                <dd><p>At some point I would love to implement a character customization interface and possibly some form of enemy character customization as well. I'm not really sure at this point how I would go about that but it does seem like an interesting idea. For sure the character customization will be a must. I want players to be able to choose between a feminine or masculine esque main character as well as being able to control many individual aspects of the characters appearance to match their personal tastes.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #10: Weapons</p></dt>
                <dd><p>As with any good FPS, a fully stocked arsenal of various weapons will need to be a must. This is going to entail many different details from icon art to actually finding gun models that will fit well in the game. Much more research will need to be done to bring this to fruition but as always, I welcome the learning experience</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #11: Character Skill Tree</p></dt>
                <dd><p>Another thing I want to implement will be a character skill tree. I haven't given much thought to the structure or how it's going to work yet but it is certainly something that I will want to have in the future.</p></dd>

                <dt><p>Update #12: </p></dt>
                <dd><p>I may want to add a flying aspect to the game. Possibly in the form of rocket boosters on the characters feet or maybe even a jetpack. Another implementation I want to do is the addition of some type of vehicles, probably flying vehicles of some sort also.</p></dd>
